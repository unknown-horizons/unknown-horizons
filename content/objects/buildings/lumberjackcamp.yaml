# TUTORIAL:
# First, we define general properties, which are read by standard python code.
# Below, there's then the list of components, which are fully specified here (no extra database needed)
# The lumberjack has a HealthComponent in order to be destructible,
# and a ProducerComponent to produce boards out of the raw trees the lumberjack unit collects.
# The storage component has space for both raw trees and boards.
# Finally, actionsets define how the building looks like in different tiers.
# Inventory overlays then are small animations added to these base images depending on currently stored things.
