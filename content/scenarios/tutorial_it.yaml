  - Available companies in the first tier are the Hunter and Fisher.
  - Il Cacciatore caccia gli animali selvatici nei boschi, perciò deve essere posizionato in una foresta.
  - Per esempio puoi mettere la falegnameria e la capanna del Cacciatore vicine.
  - Può succedere che gli animali non si riproducano in fretta o che si nascondano.

    The Fisher needs a coastal building site like the warehouse and a fish school in range.'
  - He will build a small rowing vessel and catch some fish.
  - This is a very constant supply at the cost of a slightly longer production time per unit of food.
  - A small settlement like yours can use both companies, and you can better balance pros and cons if you see the direct comparison.

  - Evita di mettere le costruzioni principali vicino alla falegnameria poichè rimuoveranno gli alberi che il boscaiolo utilizza per produrre beni.

  - Tents are the basic residential buildings. Your inhabitants will want to upgrade it when they reach higher tiers.
  - Note that the upgrade of each building requires construction material, like wood for their first upgrade.
  - Consider to disable the upgrade if your stock of these materials is low.
  - Settlers may not look very useful since they will try to consume all goods you produce - but they at least pay taxes, and that's the only way you can make money for now!

  - Can you see the ship passing your island from time to time? That ship belongs to the Free Trader, one of the first settlers in this archipelago.
  - The trader will supply your settlement with necessary goods which you can't produce yet.
  - You can also sell surpluses of your production, but in general consuming them (by building more tents) instead of selling them yields more profit.
  - Normally the trader ships just sail around and look for deals, but you can speed things up a bit.
  - - Gallery
    - [content/gui/icons/buildmenu/006_h.png]
  - For this purpose, build a signal fire at the coast near your warehouse. It will show ships the way to your settlement.
  - The signal fire has to cover the area which the ships pass through to catch them.

  - [Message, Reach an island stock of at least 30 tools. Note that this might take a while.]

  - [Image, content/gui/images/background/hr.png]
  - 'Excellent! The Free Trader will now stop by at your warehouse from time to time.


    Let''s continue our tutorial on how to trade.'
  - After selecting a particular type of good, the green bar across the bottom of the slot (if visible) shows you how much you have in stock of this good.
  - Dragging the slider on the right of each slot determines your 'target value' which has a different meaning on 'Buy' and 'Sell'.
  - When buying, you will buy sufficient to hold your 'target value' in stock.
  - When selling, the 'target value' is the stock amount at which you will always stop selling until you get more of that resource again.
  - [Pagebreak]
  - '

    For example:

    Having a ''Buy'' slot and 5 tons in stock, a slider positioned at 9 tons will cause you to buy 4 additional tons at most.'
  - Selling works similarly. A 'Sell' slot with 18 tons in stock and the slider positioned at 13 will sell up to 5 tons.
  - If the free trader however only wants to buy or sell less than your settings would allow him, you need to live with that and wait for him to return.
  - 'Unknown Horizons features smart pricing, so the value of one unit can vary.

    It is NOT possible to change prices manually!'

  - Those tools will be enough for the moment. Well done!
  - You now provide housing, a main square and food to your inhabitants.
  - Still there is one demand which we have not satisfied so far, you may check that in the marketplace or tent tab - your sailors want a basic building where they can pray.
  - The solution is a pavilion which the village parson quickly puts up as shelter from the sun.
  - Service buildings like this also need to be connected to the tents with a trail, else your inhabitants feel unable to reach them.
  - [Pagebreak]
  - '

    Note that faith is treated like a physical resource!'
  - This means that your inhabitants need a road connection to the producer (pavilion) to pick up faith there.
  - After some time, they will have consumed it and then again look for a producer to collect more faith.
  - 'Important:

    It is NOT enough that the building is merely within a certain range of the tents.

    The road connection is required as well.'

  - All demands are fulfilled now if your inhabitants can regularly visit the main square & pavilion and your food supply is adequate.
  - If the sailors are happy enough, they want to advance to the next tier called Pioneers.
  - To make them happy, there is nothing else for you to do but setting taxes to a lower level since you have fulfilled all the demands of your inhabitants.
  - You should try to not always run on low taxes since this will probably lead to bankruptcy sooner or later. For a period of time and if you know what you are doing, it is fine though.
  - After some time, the first unit should walk to the main square and have a look for new construction material there to build a log house. This house will replace the old tent.
  - [Pagebreak]
  - '

    Such residential upgrades cost resources and can thus be restricted at the main square.'
  - There also are upgrades of buildings without costs, as you will see with the lumberjack. In this case, only the graphics change.
  - Upgraded housing accomodates more inhabitants, and pioneers pay more taxes than sailors, too.
  - As you may have figured out already, the downside is that pioneers demand additional goods which sailors do not need - so you will need to spend this extra money to make them happy as well.
  - '

  - Now you have access to new buildings, take a look at the Build menu again.
  - - Gallery
    - [content/gui/icons/tabwidget/buildmenu/tier/tier2_u.png]
  - A shiny new tab appeared there.
  - Pioneers will demand cloth, so you need to set up a production line for cloth starting with lambs wool (which is one of the goods produced at the farm).
  - The farm is a very special production building since it can produce not only one, but very many (and different) goods if you choose.
  - The output of farms depends on what kind of fields you build around it.
  - [Pagebreak]
  - '

    We will have a closer look at this later.'
  - Farms, like all companies producing raw materials, do not necessarily need to be connected to storage or a warehouse.
  - As long as units of the final production company can reach the farm, and collectors from the warehouse or storage tent can reach the final company everything's fine.
  - If you, however, plan to do some processing on different parts of the island (which can make sense) or even on different islands, you will need a connection to collectors.
  - Try to build the farm not too close to the coast or your existing buildings since it will need some space around it to work well.

  - [Message, Costruisci almeno un pascolo ed aggiungi campi di patate se lo desideri.]
  - [Headline, 'OBIETTIVO: I CAMPI']
  - [Image, content/gui/images/background/hr.png]
  - The farm itself is not going to produce anything without some fields.
  - You currently have the choice between pastures, potato and sugar fields.
  - 'Let''s have a short overview:

    * Pasture: Sheep live here, producing lamb wool.

    * Potato field: Grows potatoes which are currently treated as food.

    * Sugar field: Grows sugar which is used to distill liquor and (later) produce confectionery.'
  - We now only need pastures, but in case your food supply chain is too small (maybe many residential buildings) you can also produce some potatoes.
  - Note that for potatoes you will need a road connection to the farm (not to the field!) as it will be the only company to work on the goods.
  - [Pagebreak]
  - '

    Make sure that all fields you build are in the area covered by the farm.'
  - You can have combined production - one pasture will not lead to 100 percent efficiency of the farm - but you need to check how many fields one farm can serve.
  - Different classes of fields require the farm units to spend more or less time there (to seed, harvest, herd, etc…) and because of that, the farm may be unable to serve all of the fields you built for it in time.
  - For now, you do not need to care about these issues a lot since you haven't built any fields. Let's change that!
  - '

    TASK: Build at least one pasture in the farm''s range and add potato fields if you like.'

- &STORAGE
  - [Message, Build a storage tent (tier I tab) where it makes sense.]
  - [Headline, 'OBIETTIVO: I MAGAZZINI']
  - [Image, content/gui/images/background/hr.png]
  - Did you watch your lumberjack recently?
  - Since your warehouse does not have unlimited space to store goods, collectors will stop fetching goods from companies when stock is full.
  - So if no sailors recently wanted to upgrade their tents, you probably have a lot of boards and in that case, the lumberjack may idle.
  - We can improve this situation in two different ways, and we will have a look at both of them below.
  - 'All companies offer to do no work at all.

    This may sound strange, but click on the gear wheel you see in a lumberjack hut''s overview.'
  - If this 'break' mode is enabled (we call it 'Decommissioning'), the running costs you pay for the building will decrease. They won't be zero, but still lower than if you keep the company producing.
  - - Gallery

  - [Pagebreak]
  - '

    This means that you can save money when you temporarily do not need a company and do not want to tear it down, either.'
  - 'Another solution is to build the last tier-I building which has not been mentioned so far: the storage tent.'
  - 'This building has two purposes. It:

    * Offers more storage for your goods, and

    * sends its own collectors to fetch goods, just like the warehouse does.'
  - Note that companies can also be connected to a storage in order to get their products collected, and if the warehouse is overwhelmed with collector tasks, you can place a storage tent to help out there.

  - Now the wool production is set up, you still need a weaver to produce cloth out of this wool.
  - There are two spots where you can build it - either close to the farm or close to a Storage Tent (or the warehouse).
  - In both cases you should ensure the connection to a trail as well.
  - You can place the weaver close to the farm and tear down any trail to the farm to see that it will still fetch the wool and produce.
