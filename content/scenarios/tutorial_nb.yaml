  - Your residents need a main square where they can fetch their goods from.
  - This means that they need a trail connection from their home to the Main Square. Note that the Main Square acts as trail as well, therefore adjacent Tents do not need a separate Trail.
  - All goods in your Warehouse are available at this 'market place', so your residents do not need to walk to the Fisherman's Tent or even to the Warehouse.

  - You should avoid placing your main settlement tents too close to your lumberjacks because building tents will clear away the trees that your lumberjack needs to produce boards.

  - The trader will supply your settlement with necessary goods which you can't produce yet.

  - 'Excellent! The Free Trader will now stop by at your Warehouse from time to time.


    Let''s continue our tutorial on how to trade.'
  - First click on your own Warehouse and click on the third tab.
  - Then click on one of the 3 slots, then select a good you want to buy or sell.
  - After selecting a particular type of good, the green bar across the bottom of the slot (if visible) shows you how much you have in stock of this good.
  - Dragging the slider on the right of each slot determines your 'target value' which has a different meaning on 'Buy' and 'Sell'.
  - When buying, you will buy sufficient to hold your 'target value' in stock.
  - When selling, the 'target value' is the stock amount at which you will always stop selling until you get more of that resource again.
  - [Pagebreak]
  - '

    For example:

    Having a ''Buy'' slot and 5 tons in stock, a slider positioned at 9 tons will cause you to buy 4 additional tons at most.'
  - Selling works similarly. A 'Sell' slot with 18 tons in stock and the slider positioned at 13 will sell up to 5 tons.
  - If the Free Trader however only wants to buy or sell less than your settings would allow him, you need to live with that and wait for him to return.

    Note that faith is treated like a physical resource!'
  - This means that your inhabitants need a road connection to the producer (Pavilion) to pick up faith there.

  - All demands are fulfilled now if your inhabitants can regularly visit the Main Square and the Pavilion and your food supply is adequate.
  - If the sailors are happy enough, they want to advance to the next tier called Pioneers.
  - To make them happy, there is nothing else for you to do but setting taxes to a lower level since you have fulfilled all the demands of your inhabitants.
  - You should try to not always run on low taxes since this will probably lead to bankruptcy sooner or later. For a period of time and if you know what you are doing, it is fine though.
  - After some time, the first unit should walk to the Main Square and have a look for new construction material there to build a log house. This house will replace the old tent.
  - [Pagebreak]
  - '

    Such residential upgrades cost resources and can thus be restricted at the Main Square.'
  - There also are upgrades of buildings without costs, as you will see with the lumberjack. In this case, only the graphics change.
  - Upgraded housing accomodates more inhabitants, and pioneers pay more taxes than sailors, too.
  - As you may have figured out already, the downside is that pioneers demand additional goods which sailors do not need - so you will need to spend this extra money to make them happy as well.

    - [content/gui/icons/tabwidget/buildmenu/tier/tier2_u.png]
  - A shiny new tab appeared there.
  - Pioneers will demand cloth, so you need to set up a production line for cloth starting with lambs wool (which is one of the goods produced at the Farm).
  - The Farm is a very special production building since it can produce not only one, but many (and different) goods if you choose.
  - The output of Farms depends on what kind of fields you build around it.
  - [Pagebreak]
  - '

    We will have a closer look at this later.'
  - Farms, like all companies producing raw materials, do not necessarily need to be connected to storage or a Warehouse.
  - As long as units of the final production company can reach the Farm, and collectors from the Warehouse or Storage Tent can reach the final company everything's fine.
  - If you, however, plan to do some processing on different parts of the island (which can make sense) or even on different islands, you will need a connection to collectors.
  - Try to build the Farm not too close to the coast or your existing buildings since it will need some space around it to work well.

  - The Farm itself is not going to produce anything without some fields.
  - You currently have the choice between pastures, potato and sugar fields.

    * Pasture: Sheep live here, producing lamb wool.

    * Potato Field: Grows potatoes which are currently treated as food.

    * Sugar Field: Grows sugar which is used to distill liquor and (later) produce confectionery.'
  - We now only need pastures, but in case your food supply chain is too small (maybe many residential buildings) you can also produce some potatoes.
  - Note that for potatoes you will need a road connection to the Farm (not to the field!), as it will be the only company to work on the goods.
  - [Pagebreak]
  - '

    Make sure that all fields you build are in the area covered by the Farm.'
  - You can have combined production - one pasture will not lead to 100 percent efficiency of the Farm - but you need to check how many fields one Farm can serve.
  - Different classes of fields require the farm units to spend more or less time there (to seed, harvest, herd, etc…) and because of that, the farm may be unable to serve all of the fields you built for it in time.
  - For now, you do not need to care about these issues a lot since you haven't built any fields. Let's change that!

  - [Headline, 'NEW TASK: BUILD STORAGE']
  - [Image, content/gui/images/background/hr.png]
  - Did you watch your lumberjack recently?
  - Since your Warehouse does not have unlimited space to store goods, collectors will stop fetching goods from companies when stock is full.
  - So if no sailors recently wanted to upgrade their tents, you probably have a lot of boards and in that case, the lumberjack may idle.
  - We can improve this situation in two different ways, and we will have a look at both of them below.
  - 'All companies offer to do no work at all.

    This may sound strange, but click on the gear wheel you see in the Lumberjack Hut''s overview.'
  - If this 'break' mode is enabled (we call it 'Decommissioning'), the running costs you pay for the building will decrease. They won't be zero, but still lower than if you keep the company producing.

    This means that you can save money when you temporarily do not need a company and do not want to tear it down, either.'

  - 'This building has two purposes. It:

    * Offers more storage for your goods, and

    * sends its own collectors to fetch goods, just like the Warehouse does.'
