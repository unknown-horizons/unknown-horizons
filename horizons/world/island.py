class Island(BuildingOwner, WorldObject):
	"""The Island class represents an island. It contains a list of all things on the map
	that belong to the island. This comprises ground tiles as well as buildings,
	nature objects (which are buildings), and units.
	All those objects also have a reference to the island, making it easy to determine to which island the instance belongs.
	An Island instance is created during map creation, when all tiles are added to the map.
	@param origin: Point instance - Position of the (0, 0) ground tile.
	@param filename: file from which the island is loaded.

	Each island holds some important attributes:
	* grounds - All ground tiles that belong to the island are referenced here.
	* grounds_map -  a dictionary that binds tuples of coordinates with a reference to the tile:
	                  { (x, y): tileref, ...}
					  This is important for pathfinding and quick tile fetching.
	* position - a Rect that borders the island with the smallest possible area.
	* buildings - a list of all Building instances that are present on the island.
	* settlements - a list of all Settlement instances that are present on the island.
	* path_nodes - a special dictionary used by the pather to save paths.

	TUTORIAL:
	Why do we use a separate __init() function, and do not use the __init__() function?
	Simple: if we load the game, the class is not loaded as a new instance, so the __init__
	function is not called. Rather, the load function is called, so everything that new
	classes and loaded classes share to initialize goes into the __init() function.
	This is the common way of doing this in Unknown Horizons, so better get used to it :)
	NOTE: The components work a bit different, but this code here is mostly not component oriented.

	To continue hacking, check out the __init() function now.
