class Island(BuildingOwner, WorldObject):
	"""The Island class represents an Island by keeping a list of all instances on the map,
	that belong to the island. The island variable is also set on every instance that belongs
	to an island, making it easy to determine to which island the instance belongs, when
	selected.
	An Island instance is created at map creation, when all tiles are added to the map.
	@param origin: Point instance - Position of the (0, 0) ground tile.
	@param filename: file from which the island is loaded.

	Each island holds some important attributes:
	* grounds - All grounds that belong to the island are referenced here.
	* grounds_map -  a dictionary that binds tuples of coordinates with a reference to the tile:
	                  { (x, y): tileref, ...}
					  This is important for pathfinding and quick tile fetching.
	* buildings - a list of all Building instances that are present on the island.
	* settlements - a list of all Settlement instances that are present on the island.
	* path_nodes - a special dictionary used by the pather to save paths.

	TUTORIAL:
	Why do we use a separate __init() function, and do not use the __init__() function?
	Simple, if we load the game, the class is not loaded as new instance, so the __init__
	function is not called. Rather the load function is called. So everything that new
	classes and loaded classes share to initialize, comes into the __init() function.
	This is the common way of doing this in Unknown Horizons, so better get used to it :)

	To continue hacking, check out the __init() function now.
