"""
Simple building management functionality.
Inherited mainly by Island, but also by World for buildings at sea such as fish.
Island adds more functionality to these functions (e.g. settlement handling),
this implementation can be viewed as the the common denominator of building handling
required by World and Island.
The instances need to provide a get_tile function.
