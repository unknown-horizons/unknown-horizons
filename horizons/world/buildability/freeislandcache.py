	"""
	An instance of this class is used to keep track of the unclaimed area on an island.

	Instances of this class can answer the same queries as BinaryBuildabilityCache.
	It is specialized for keeping track of the unclaimed land on an island. That way it
	is possible to use it in conjunction with the TerrainCache to find all available
	warehouse positions on an island.

	Note that the cache is initialized with all unclaimed tiles on the island and after
	that it can only reduce in size because it is currently impossible for land to change
	ownership after it has been claimed by the first player.
