	A cache that knows where rectangles can be placed such that they are entirely inside the area.

	This cache can be used to keep track of building buildability in case the
	buildability depends on the building being entirely within a certain area.
	The binary part of the name refers to the fact that a node either is or isn't part of
	the area that the instance is about.

	A query of the form (x, y) in instance.cache[(width, height)] is a very cheap way of
	finding out whether a rectangle of size (width, height) can be placed on origin (x, y)
	such that it is entirely within the given area.

	All elements of instance.cache[(width, height)] can be iterated to get a complete list
	of all such coordinates.
