		By now you should know the basic constructs used in UH, so we feel comfortable
		stopping the tutorial here. Be sure to join our IRC channel and idle around there.
		You'll find tasks for getting into the code in our trac.unknown-horizons.org.

		Other relevant parts of the code you might be interested in are:
		* commands: horizons/commands. Abstracts all user interactions.
		* scheduler: horizons/scheduler.py. Manages ingame time.
		* extscheduler: horizons/extscheduler.py. Manages wall clock time.
		* scenario: horizons/scenario. Condition-action system for scenarios and full campaigns
		* automatic tests: tests/. Contains unit tests, gui tests and game (system) tests
		* networking: horizons/network. Sending stuff over the wire
		* concreteobject: horizons/world/concreteobject.py. Things with graphical representations
		* gui: horizons/gui. The ugly parts. IngameGui and Gui, tabs and widgets.
		* production: horizons/world/production
		** Producer: producer component, manages everything
		** ProductionLine: keeps data about the different production lines.
		** Production: the alive version of the production line. Used when a building
		               actually produces something, stores progress and the like.
		* engine: horizons/engine. Direct interface to fife.
		* ai: horizons/ai/aiplayer. Way too big to describe here.
