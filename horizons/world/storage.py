"""
Here we define how the inventories work, that are used by world objects.
These storage classes exist:

- GenericStorage (abstract): Defines general interface for storage.

Storages with certain properties:
- PositiveStorage: Doesn't allow negative values.
- TotalStorage: Sum of all stored res must be <= a certain limit.
- SpecializedStorage: Allows only certain resources to be stored here.
- SizedSpecializedStorage: Like SpecializedStorage, but each res has an own limit.

Combinations:
- SizedSlottedStorage: One limit, each res value must be <= the limit and >= 0.
- PositiveTotalStorage: use case: ship inventory
- PositiveSizedSlotStorage: every res has the same limit, only positive values (warehouse, collectors)
- PositiveSizedSpecializedStorage: Like SizedSpecializedStorage, plus only positive values.
