	It inherits from BuildingOwner, among other things, so it has building management capabilities.
	There is always one big reference per building, which is stored in either the world, the island,
	or the settlement.

	The main components of the world are:
	   * players - a list of all the session's players - Player instances
	   * islands - a list of all the map's islands - Island instances
	   * grounds - a list of all the map's groundtiles
	   * ground_map - a dictionary that binds tuples of coordinates with a reference to the tile:
	                  { (x, y): tileref, ...}
	                 This is important for pathfinding and quick tile fetching.
	   * island_map - a dictionary that binds tuples of coordinates with a reference to the island
	   * ships - a list of all the ships ingame - horizons.world.units.ship.Ship instances
	   * ship_map - same as ground_map, but for ships
	   * session - reference to horizons.session.Session instance of the current game
	   * trader - The world's ingame free trader player instance (can control multiple ships)
	   * pirate - The world's ingame pirate player instance
	   TUTORIAL: You should now check out the _init() function.
