class FieldBuilder(Component):
	"""
	Component for production buildings. It adds a hook `fill_range` to fill the
	building range with a specified 1x1 field. The usual buildability constraints
	for that field apply. `fill_range` will only succeed if the cost for filling
	the entire range can be paid - there is no automated partial construction.
	For GUI purposes, some more information is exposed:
	- how many fields would be built at once
	- total resource cost
	- whether the build is affordable right now.
