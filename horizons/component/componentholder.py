class ComponentHolder(object):
	"""
	Class that manages Component plug-ins
	It can be inherited by all objects that can hold components

	TUTORIAL:
	I can't explain component-oriented architecture to you here, but I can give you
	an overview of how we use it:
	Instead of putting all different features of entities into single classes,
	as is common in OOP, each feature is put into a component. This should
	increase the encapsulation, and it's easier if an object consists of 15 independent
	building blocks than if it were 15 classes, where many override the same function call
	and fight about who gets called first.
	Check class_mapping for a complete list of the different components we use.

	The components are stored in a dict, where the key is their name (a string).
	This is necessary so objects can be defined as a collection of their components in
	human readable format. This is done via yaml files in content/objects in our case.
	You could check out e.g. content/objects/buildings/lumberjackcamp.yaml to see what
	it looks like.

	This class manages the components; it stores them and makes them accessible.
	Check out the actual component class in horizons/component/__init__.py.
