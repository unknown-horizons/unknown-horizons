"""
How GUI tests are run:

A test marked with the `gui_test` decorator will be collected by pytest.
When this test is run, it will launch the game in a subprocess, passing it the
dotted path to the test (along with other options), similar to this code:

	def test_example():
		returncode = subprocess.call(['python3', 'run_uh.py', '--gui-test',
		                              'tests.gui.minimap'])
		if returncode != 0:
			assert False

	def minimap(gui):
		menu = gui.find(name='mainmenu')

	Tests have to be generators. With generators, we can give control back to the
	engine anytime we want and easily continue at that point later.
	Letting the engine run is important, because otherwise no timer will be
	continued and for example a production will never finish.

	Dialogs need to be handled slightly different. Their execution results in a
	separate call to the engine's mainloop, in turn, this would call the `_tick`
	method and attempt to continue the generator (which is still running).

	Therefore, a new generator has to be installed to handle dialogs. Handlers are
	hold in list used as stack - only the last added handler will be continued
	until it has finished.
