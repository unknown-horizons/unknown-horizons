"""
How GUI tests are run:

A test marked with the `gui_test` decorator will be collected by nose.
When this test is run, it will launch the game in a subprocess, passing it the
dotted path to the test (along with other options), similar to this code:

	def test_example():
		returncode = subprocess.call(['python', 'run_uh.py', '--gui-test',
									  'tests.gui.minimap'])
		if returncode != 0:
			assert False

	def minimap(gui):
		menu = gui.find(name='mainmenu')
