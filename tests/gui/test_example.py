# The `gui_test` decorator is needed to identify gui tests. You can use it
# without argument, but is has to be `@gui_test()` (notice the parantheses).
#
# It accepts either one of these arguments:
#
# 	use_dev_map=True		- Game launches with --start-dev-map (no main menu)
# 	use_fixture='name'		- Game launches with --load-map=tests/gui/ingame/fixtures/name.sqlite
# 	ai_players=1			- Game launches with --ai-players=1
# 	timeout=3				- Game will be killed after 3 seconds
#
